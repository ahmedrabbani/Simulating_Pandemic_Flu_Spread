## Problem Statement:

In this simulation project, we consider the spread of a pandemic flu in a classroom of 21 elementary school
kids. At the beginning of the simulation, 20 of the kids are healthy and susceptible to the flu, and one kid
(Tommy) is infected with the flu virus. The infected kid has the chance of contacting everyone in the
classroom and spreading the flu to anyone he meets, at a probability p of 0.02 per day. For our initial
deterministic model, we assume that, as in the problem description, any infected person will be infectious
for 3 consecutive days. On any of the three days, any individual susceptible kid has a chance of 0.02 of
getting infected by the infectious person. After 3 days of infection, the infected kid will fully recover and
is immune to the flu.

The main questions that we would like to answer for this project include:

* How can we model the development of the infection chain initiated by Tommy over time?
* What is the distribution of student infections each day?
* How do we estimate the expected number of kids infected each day?
* What is the maximum number of kids that can stay infected on any given day?
* How long will the flu spread last among the students?
* When does the number of infections reach the peak?
* How long does the peak last?
* What precautionary measures can we recommend containing the spread of the pandemic?
